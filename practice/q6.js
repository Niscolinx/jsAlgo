//Given two strings s and t, determine whether they are isomorphic, two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
//All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself. s and t consist of any valid ascii character.


// const s = 'abacus'
// const t = 'pbpgsi'
