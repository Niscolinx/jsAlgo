// Question2
// An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing. An array is monotone increasing if all its elements fromt the left to right are non-decreasing. An array is monotone descreasing if all its elements from the left to the right are non-increasing. Given an integer array return true if the given array is monotone, or false otherwise


const isMonotonic = () => {

    //Check if the last item is greater or equal to the first element
    
    
    //Check if the last item is less than or equal to the first element
    //
}
