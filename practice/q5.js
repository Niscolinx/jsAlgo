// You are given an array of integers and another target targetValue. Write a function that will take these inputs and return the indices of the 2 integers in the array that add up to targetValue


// const arr1 = [3,5,3,6]
// const targetValue = 8

//If array has only 1 item return 0
//If two integers cannot form the targetValue return 0


//Divide targetValue by 2
// In the case of 8, it's 4 and 4
