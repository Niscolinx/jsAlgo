// Question
// You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith lines are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

// Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water(depth is constant across containers). Return the area(that the 2 lines and the X axis make) of container which can store the max amount of water. Notice that you may not slant the container

//Constraints
//y axis does not count as a wall
//A line inside the container does not affect the area

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
